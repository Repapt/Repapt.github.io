          <p className="body">As a kid, I loved puzzles. Countless hours of my childhood were spent playing with rubik's cubes,</p>
          <p className="body">mystery novels, games - anything I could get my hands on. Going into High School, my puzzle-loving brain</p>
          <p className="body">pushed me into computer science, where I became acquainted with the world of competitive programming.</p>
          <p className="body">Today, I love making games, websites, or anything else that piques my interest. I enjoy swimming,</p>
          <p className="body">basketball, cooking, guitar, and video games. I love listening to music (mostly rock, but I'll listen</p>
          <p className="body"> to anything) and I'm a huge Marvel nerd. I'm an easy cry at the movies (especially if it's animated!)</p>
          <p className="body">and I'm still mad about the final season of Game of Thrones.</p>
          <p className="body">These passions have characterized my life - and now, I'm looking for the next one.</p>
